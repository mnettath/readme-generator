# readme-generator

## Description

My goal working on this readme-generator was to help developers easily create a README.md for their projects. It is easy to forget what a README needs to include but this command-line application can help. While working on this app, I became more familiar with using node.js, installing the inquirer package, and modularization. I also learned that it is better to use the list type instead of the checkbox type when designing multiple choice questions that require a single answer.

## Installation

In order to use the readme-generator, please install node.js. Node.js can be installed using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download. It's important to download the LTS option for the computer's operating system. Next, the user will need to install the inquirer package by inputting "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in the command line. After completing these steps, the user will be ready to use the readme-generator.
